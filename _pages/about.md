I'm a computational neuroscientist and data scientist who's passionate about developing cutting-edge models and software tools to solve complex problems in both academia and industry. My doctoral research at Columbia University focused on the fascinating area of color information processing in insect brains, and I used a combination of machine learning techniques and biological experiments to explore this topic in depth. Recently, I have been working on various projects related to LLMs and building foundational models for biophysical timeseries data.

When I'm not working on my data and software projects, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors via gradient descent, playing board games with friends, and dancing salsa and the waltz.
My long-term goal is to apply my skills in data and mathematical modeling to automate complex processes and gain a deeper understanding of how we interpret the world around us.

**Gucky** [’ɡʊki] is my nickname and is derived from the colloquial German verb "gucken", which means "to look".
