## Summary

In underserved communities, elderly individuals often lack access to advanced health monitoring that could detect early signs of common issues like infections, pneumonia, and constipation. These conditions can be identified through multi-day patterns in data from wearable devices. While machine learning can enable analysis of such long-term biometric data, typical models struggle with very long input sequences. Recently developed deep state-space models overcome this limitation and scale linearly with sequence length. This project will develop a tailored deep state-space model architecture to learn individual “biometric profiles” and detect healthcare events. It will also build software tools to enable training and deployment of the models to expand access to sophisticated healthcare monitoring.
